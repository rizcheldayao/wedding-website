  "oliverBio": "Oliver aka Olly Wood grew up in a small village in Yorkshire, England. Fun fact is Robin Hood was buried in the village he grew up in. Son to Julie and Terry Wood, Julie was an ex-olympic figure skater and Terry a Professor in The Dark Arts. They pushed Oliver to pursue his dreams and move to the land of the brave and of the free, Canada. His love of North America did not stop at Canada and Oliver would once again move back to the old British colony of America.",
  "rizchelBio": "Rizchel aka Ritz Dayao grew up in Arizona, USA. She was raised by four wonderful parents, Robert & Gayleen and Rochelle & Mark, and has two half brothers, Ethan & Brandon. She went to Arizona State University (go Devils!) and her job after college took her to Austin, TX, where she met Olly. Now, they live in Denver with their two adorable pups, Darcy & Autumn! It's getting nice outside so they can start exploring the outdoors of Colorado and checking out all the breweries.",
  "storyDetails": "We first met in Austin, TX in July 2016. Olly took me wine tasting at the Oasis for our first date (best date ever!). It didn’t take long after that until we spent most of our time together and we planned a trip to Nashville about a week after we started dating (crazy huh but so worth it). Soon after, we met each other’s families and spent a couple holidays together then moved in together shortly after that. Olly proposed in December 2017 and we’re both so excited and cannot wait to celebrate with everyone and spend the rest of our lives with each other!"
